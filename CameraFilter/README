System Requirements
====================
Linux based on armv7

g++ version >= 4.8.x

USB3.0 Vision Camera:
   For best performance and stability we highly recommend a kernel version >= 3.5.0.23

Installation
====================

1. Installation shell command: "./install.sh" or "sh install.sh".

2. When you do not see any error message in the installation and the end shown as below, your installation is compelete.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
All configurations will take effect after the system is rebooted.
If you don't want to reboot the system for a while,
you will need to unplug and replug the camera before using SDK.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
    1. After your installation, You need to replug Galaxy USB3 device before using SDK.
    2. Don't install the SDK in a folder which path has chinese characters, or SDK may not work. 



Troubleshooting
====================
* In installation, if show the following message:

  "service: Command not found" 

  or

  "udev: unrecognized service"

  It means your system do not have "udev" service but still have "udev" directory. We can't help you get device permissions automatically. In this case, you need to use "sudo" to run your appliction when using U3V cameras.    
     
     
          
Performance
====================

1.When using USB3.0 Vision Camera,If you need grab image from 4 or more U3V cameras, or you need increasing the package(URB) size or count, you will likely run out of kernel space and see corresponding error messages on the console. Because of the default value of USB Kernel Space set by the kernel is 16 MB. To set the value (in this example to 1000 MB) you can
  execute as root:
      echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb
  or execute ./SetUSBStack.sh as root.
  This would assign a maximum of 1000 MB to the USB stack.

2.Performance Optimization
To increase performance and to minimize CPU usage when grabbing images, the following settings should be considered:

USB3.0 vision Camera
 Increasing Packet Size
 For faster USB transfers you should increase the packet size. You can do this by changing "StreamTransferSize" value by setting the corresponding value via the API.
